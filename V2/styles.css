/* M2LO15 used cornsilk to add a background color to my site. This allows me to add colors to text and background. 
Applying colors through css is easy and efficent. It allows me to add colors to a specific id, element or tag. 
In other parts of this code I use colors to enhance borders. */

/* M3LO9 I fixed my background image because I dont want obsessive repeats its distracts from the content */

/* M4LO2 Here I use a background image */
html{
    height: 100%;
    background-image: url(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ofCoeqnOWAM/maxresdefault.jpg);
    background-repeat: round;

    max-width: 1400px;
    width: 100%;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    background-color:cornsilk;
}

/* M3LO10 This allows my content to stretch without running off of the page instead it will add a scroll wheel when needed */
aside{
    overflow: auto;
}

/* M2LO13 Here I am using a style rule to change the font that appears on screen. Without CSS the default font would be shown. 
With CSS however I can pick which one I want. I typed in A and it let me auto complete arial, etc....   */

/* M2LO6 Here I set up a class for my heading. Since they all are h1's I made this h1 into a class and made a style rule for that class. 
This saved me time then to set other to h2 or a different size. */

/* M3LO8B This sets my heading to the left 45px I have no idea why my text align isnt working but this works so its fine */
.bop{
    text-align: center;
    font-size: x-large;
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    position: relative;
    right: 45px;
}


/* M2LO11 Here I used a Pseudo element over the h1 element. This affected every first line of my h1 headings. 
This made every h1 text italiced. I think this was more efficent because I would have had to seperate the rules for p and h1. 
I wrote them together and theres no going back now. */
h1::first-line{
    font-style: italic;
}


/* M2LO12 Here I used CSS to alter the h1 and p elements. I aligned the text left, made the font larger and added a margin rule of 340 px. 
This got me to a point where I liked where the text showed up.  */

/* M2LO3 Here I used CSS inheritence. This rule sets text alignment to the left. This works together with the other p rule. 
This is because they do not conflict on this rule. Using both elements set here allows me to add to both not not copy pasting 2 rules. 
This can be useful for when you want your text in one area. */

/* M2LO5 Here I used a different type of contextual selector. Instead of the > to form a parent and child I used a ,. 
This allowed me to list all of the elements I wanted the rule applied to. */
h1, p{
    text-align: left;
    font-size: larger;
    margin-left: 130px;
}

/* M4LO5 Adds a gray shadow to the heading texts. This pops the text and makes it look clean. */
h1{
    text-shadow: gray 5px 3px 5px;
}

/* M2LO3 Here I used style precedence. This p takes control over the other rule I set for P. Both rules share a margin and font rule. 
Only the bottom one is applied because it is the last one to change the p element. This rule allows the text to be pushed 360px right and have a medium font and different font type.  */

This gives my site a better feel just being able to see change as you go. Making sure your going to click what you think you are. */

/* M2LO14 This is a good example of progressive enhancement. Progressive enhancement is multiple strong layers coming together for a better end result. 
Here I am using HTML to make a ul. In CSS I have now centered the list and added a black background around the list. These languages building off of eachother is the strength of progressive enhancement  */

I can use this to select certain child elements from the parents. This also helps me be specific for writing a rule. */
