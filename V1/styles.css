Name: Christian Haugaard
Date: 1/24

Instructor: Sean Petterson
Assignment: Adding CSS to the website (M2)
Notes:
    M2LO3 Demonstrate style precedence and inheritance in CSS (CSS, this item should be specified 2 times, once where precedence is applied and once where inheritance is applied; see 2-3d Style Specificity and Precedence, and 2-3e Style Inheritance)
    M2LO4 Demonstrate external, embedded, and inline styles (HTML, this item should be specified 2 times, once each for embedded and inline styles; note external was taken care of with M1LO8; see 2-3b Embedded Style Sheets, and 2-3c Inline Styles)
    M2LO5 Demonstrate contextual selectors (CSS, specify 2 times, showing two different types of contextual selectors as shown in Figure 2-12, Contextual Selectors, of the textbook)
    M2LO6  Demonstrate a CSS id and a CSS class selector (CSS, specify 2 times, show a use of id and a use of class, see 2-9b Attribute selectors)
    M2LO7 Demonstrate a CSS attribute selector other than class or id (CSS, specify 1 time, see 2-9b Attribute selectors)
